Project that tested knowledge of d-ary heaps with its implementation and a report to find an optimal d-value for a certain application.
In this project, I specifically analyzed d-ary heaps in Dijkstra's Algorithm
Excuse the poor latex formatting.

Go to ./heap/ for the code
Go to ./report/ for the report (includes latex file)
