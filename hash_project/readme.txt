A project that tested knowledge of hashmaps.
Involved taking a keyword text file and another text file, then finding how many of the keywords in the keyword text file were used in the other text file using hashmaps.
Other various statistics from the text file were also measured.

I did not implement my own hash function and just used the STL's one.
