This project tested knowledge of two sorting algorithms: quicksort and radix sort.
Both sorts were implemented in C++.
After implementation of the sorts, runtimes of the two sorting algorithms were compared and contrasted for several datasets.
Analysis of the results can be found in JoshuaTensuanSortingProjectReport.pdf and the .tex files can be found in the project folder
