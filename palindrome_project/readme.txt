Short max palindrome project that tested knowledge of linked lists.
Main method uses a given argument vector to print the length of the longest palindrome from the end.
-This ran in O(n^3)
-We were not allowed to reverse the linked lists.
-ex. racecar returns 7 (palindrome of racecar)
-    winrar returns 3 (palindrome of rar)
-    batt returns 2 (palindrome of tt)
-    cat returns 1 (no palindrome)
