This project tested knowledge of graphs on Euclidean space, analyzing several interesting properties such as connectedness and number of edges.
More in depth info is given in the report

The code folder contains all the code required for this project.
The graph.hpp file contains the class declarations for the Euclidean Graph class.
The point.hpp file contains the class declarations for the point class.
The main.cpp file contains the implementation of the Euclidean Graph class to analyze the relationships mentioned in the report.

Also in the code folder are .txt files which contain the results.
i.e "edges5.txt" contains threshold distance on the left and scaled # of edges on the right with 5 points.
Text files that start with connected contains threshold distance on the left and probability of connectedness on the right.

The code folder also contains 2 .png images of the graphs produced which are also in the report.

The code folder also contains a .git that tracked commits and work.


The report is found in JoshuaTensuan-Graphing_Report.pdf.


The latex folder contains all the needed latex material to create the report.
